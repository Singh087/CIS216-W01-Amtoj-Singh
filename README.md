# CIS216-W01
CIS 216 – Applied Object-Oriented Programming

Student: Amtoj Singh

About This Course

I am taking CIS 216 because I want to strengthen my programming skills beyond the basics and learn how to apply object-oriented programming to real-world problems. This course will also help me prepare for higher-level courses at DePaul University and support my career goals in technology.

Programming Language Selection

For this class, I selected Python 3. I chose Python because it is widely used in many areas of technology such as web development, data analysis, and automation. It has simple syntax, a strong community, and a lot of resources available, which makes it a great language for practicing object-oriented programming concepts.

How I Plan to Use Python

I plan to use Python as my main language for developing applications and solving problems throughout this course. In the future, I intend to use Python for projects involving data analysis, automation, and potentially in my work as a network engineer where scripting and system management are valuable skills.


In Session 2, I learned how to use methods inside a class to organize my code in a cleaner way. I took my original BMI script and rebuilt it into a BMICalculator class that has methods for checking inputs, calculating BMI, and showing the category results. This made the program easier to understand, reuse, and even expand—like adding support for both metric and imperial units. Moving forward, I plan to keep using this approach of breaking code into clear methods so my programs are easier to read, maintain, and build on in both my coursework and future IT work.



Session 3 – Properties
In this session I learned how to use properties to keep class data safe and organized. I added getters and setters with validation for things like name, email, age, GPA, and credits, plus some computed properties like full-time status, class standing, and BMI. This showed me how properties make code easier to manage and more reliable, which I can use in future projects and my career.


Session 4 – Validation: I validated inputs (types, ranges, simple patterns, and cross-references) and used try/except so bad data didn’t crash the app. I also checked date consistency and kept good/bad records separate, which made the program feel more real and reliable.
