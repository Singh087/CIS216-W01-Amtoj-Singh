# CIS216-W01
CIS 216 â€“ Applied Object-Oriented Programming

Student: Amtoj Singh

About This Course

I am taking CIS 216 because I want to strengthen my programming skills beyond the basics and learn how to apply object-oriented programming to real-world problems. This course will also help me prepare for higher-level courses at DePaul University and support my career goals in technology.

Programming Language Selection

For this class, I selected Python 3. I chose Python because it is widely used in many areas of technology such as web development, data analysis, and automation. It has simple syntax, a strong community, and a lot of resources available, which makes it a great language for practicing object-oriented programming concepts.

How I Plan to Use Python

I plan to use Python as my main language for developing applications and solving problems throughout this course. In the future, I intend to use Python for projects involving data analysis, automation, and potentially in my work as a network engineer where scripting and system management are valuable skills.
